# Liliesh
Tech nerd / part-time goofball / enby (also questioning)

Meowing at random times to confuse people is my ✨ passion ✨ :3c

When not trying to confuse people, I enjoy exploring linux related topics, work on my homelab and develop software.

Occasionally I get a hyperfixation on fanfictions and books. During that time I will talk A LOT about the stuff I'm reading.
